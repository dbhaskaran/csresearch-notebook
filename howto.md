# How to read a Computer Science Research Paper?

### Getting started:
---
Note: Requires a lot of Patience, Practice and Coffee :)

- Have a goal:
  - Reading papers can be time consuming and requires lot of attention and effort.
  - Without a clear goal and target, it can be demotivating.
      - Good Goal: Gain a deeper understanding of Parallel programming, Concurrency and Multithreading in Java.
      - Bad Goal: Become a good Java developer. (This can be attained by reading books and working on projects)

### The 3 Pass Approach:
---
#### Zeroth Pass - Get a feel of the paper
- You are "somewhat" familiar with the broader idea. If not, read a book, tutorial or take a course to become familiar.
- Get a feel of the paper


#### First Pass - Get the big picture
- Skim the Title, Abstract, Headings, Conclusion and Reference
- Ignore the deeper Math and Complex logic.
- Identify the aim of the paper. *What problem does it solve?*
- What other people are saying about the paper?
- Is it worth reading?

#### Second Pass - Get the details - Comprehension
- Make critical notes of the concepts in the paper.
- Read the contents.
- Pay attention to diagrams, system models and graphs.
- Get a High-Level understanding of the contents.
- Understand and associate code or implementations.

#### Third Pass - Evaluate the details
- Understand the complex logic and math. (Use wikipedia or Google if you are lost)
- Discuss the paper with other on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csbooks/), [stackexchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/what-papers-should-everyone-read) and other forums.

### Moving On: - Synthesize the details
---
- Create or join meetup groups to discuss papers.
- Teach papers you understand well to others.
- What to retain?
  * The problem.
  * Basic idea of the proposed solution.
  * Your notes on papers math.
  * Shortcomings of the proposed approach.
- Identify
  * What problem is the paper trying to solve?
  * What are the limitations of prior work?
  * How is the problem solved by this paper?
  * How is the problem solved by this paper?
  * How is the proposed solution evaluated?
