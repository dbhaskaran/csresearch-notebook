# How to read a Computer Science Research Paper?

### Getting started:
---
Note: Requires a lot of Patience, Practice and Coffee :)

- Have a goal:
  - Reading papers can be time consuming and requires lot of attention and effort.
  - Without a clear goal and target, it can be demotivating.
      - Good Goal: Gain a deeper understanding of Parallel programming, Concurrency and Multithreading in Java.
      - Bad Goal: Become a good Java developer. (This can be attained by reading books and working on projects)

### The 3 Pass Approach:
---
#### First Pass
- Skim the Title, Abstract, Headings, Conclusion and Reference
- Ignore the deeper Math and Complex logic.
- Identify the aim of the paper. What problem does it solve?
- What other people are saying about the paper?
- Is it worth reading?

#### Second Pass
- Make critical notes of the concepts in the paper.
- Read the contents.
- Grasp the concept illustrated in diagrams and graphs.
- Get a High-Level understanding of the contents.
- Understand and associate code or implementations.

#### Third Pass
- Understand the complex logic and math. (Use wikipedia or Google if you are lost)
- Discuss the paper with other on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csbooks/), [stackexchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/what-papers-should-everyone-read) and other forums.

### Moving On:
---
- Create or join meetup groups to discuss papers.
- Teach papers you understand well to others.
